Adobe Systems (ADBE) is a computer software development company operating in five segments: Digital Media Solutions, Digital Enterprise Solutions, Creative and Interactive Solutions, Omniture, and Print and Publishing. While most people are familiar with Adobe through Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash Player, these include only a small fraction of the company’s revenue. The bulk (84%) is comprised of professional graphics and communication software. Adobe Flash and Photoshop are the industry leaders, well ahead of competitors and open source software. It is the most used software in universities, creating a loyal customer base that has been trained from youth to preform best when using Adobe’s software.  Adobe ($24.40 as of 9/7/11) is selling at a PE of 13, well below its 31 median PE, and 11x net free cash. The company has an estimated $5.32 of cash and short term investments per share. Debt is 12% of cap, 60% of it long term, and no liabilities of a pension plan. Current ratio is a strong 3:1. Its margins are around the industry average, however it has a lower return on total capital of 13% vs. industry average of 23%.  Adobe fell 32% since May. Competition fears from big companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) as well as overall market conditions have contributed to this decline. If Adobe cannot lead the innovative front it may lose market share. However, Adobe has carved a strong niche in graphic design and media software and it is not likely they will lose this position anytime soon. Software companies tend to get hurt in a recession when demand for software slides. Adobe’s strong financial strength adds safety to this otherwise risky industry. Solid revenues, cash flow, earnings, and intangible assets of brand loyalty make Adobe a serious consideration at this price.
